## WHAT IS PHISHING 
Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text 
message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data 
such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.  

The architecture of a phishing attack is dynamic, adapting to the evolving landscape of cybersecurity. 
Social engineering techniques are often employed to gather information about potential victims, 
tailoring deceptive communications to match individual preferences and contexts. The perpetrators, 
akin to digital puppeteers, exploit the human element as the weakest link in the security chain.   

As the digital ecosystem continues to expand, so too does the sophistication of phishing schemes. 
Advanced technologies, such as spear-phishing and whaling, target specific high-profile individuals or 
organizations, demonstrating a chilling level of precision in their deceit. The battle against phishing 
requires not only robust technical defenses but also a vigilant and informed user base capable of 
recognizing the subtle signs of these virtual masquerades.  

In the vast seas of cyberspace, phishing stands as a lurking threat, underscoring the imperative for 
constant vigilance and education. Understanding the tactics employed by these virtual predators is 
the first line of defense against their elusive and damaging endeavors.

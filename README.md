## PROJECT SCOPE 
The subject of the project is what is phishing, how is it done, what should be taken into consideration, 
what risks does it pose?

## WHAT IS PHISHING 
Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text 
message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data 
such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.  

The architecture of a phishing attack is dynamic, adapting to the evolving landscape of cybersecurity. 
Social engineering techniques are often employed to gather information about potential victims, 
tailoring deceptive communications to match individual preferences and contexts. The perpetrators, 
akin to digital puppeteers, exploit the human element as the weakest link in the security chain.   

As the digital ecosystem continues to expand, so too does the sophistication of phishing schemes. 
Advanced technologies, such as spear-phishing and whaling, target specific high-profile individuals or 
organizations, demonstrating a chilling level of precision in their deceit. The battle against phishing 
requires not only robust technical defenses but also a vigilant and informed user base capable of 
recognizing the subtle signs of these virtual masquerades.  

In the vast seas of cyberspace, phishing stands as a lurking threat, underscoring the imperative for 
constant vigilance and education. Understanding the tactics employed by these virtual predators is 
the first line of defense against their elusive and damaging endeavors.    

## THE AIM OF PHISHING ATTACKS 
Phishing attacks are generally attacks aimed at gaining sensitive and confidential information such as 
usernames, passwords, credit card information, and network credentials. Cyber attackers use social 
engineering by posing as a normal individual or organization via phone or email to manipulate victims 
into taking certain actions—such as clicking on a harmful link or attachment—or willingly disclosing 
confidential information.    

The aim here is; The aim is to convince the recipient of the e-mail that there is something they want 
or need in the message - such as a request from the bank of which they are a customer or an e-mail 
from a colleague at their company. Aside from email, phishing scams can also use phone calls, text 
messages, and social media to trick victims into providing sensitive information.    


## METHODS USED IN PHISHING ATTACKS 
Phishing attacks generally occur in three stages. In the first stage, people who will carry out phishing 
attacks create fake web pages that give the impression that they belong to a real institution (for 
example, from Instagram, Paynet, Akbank etc.). In the second stage, electronic mails (e-mails) that 
appear to be from real institutions are sent to large user groups, and in these mails, users are asked 
to open the link provided and enter their information.   

At this point, a false excuse is usually given, such as the user information has been deleted because 
there was a problem in the institution's database and therefore the information must be re-entered. 
At this stage, the information of those who find the incoming e-mail credible, open the link and enter 
their information falls into the hands of the attackers. In the third and final stage of the attack, 
people's credit cards are used illegally or their bank accounts are emptied by using this information.    

Phishing attacks are not always carried out via e-mail. Sometimes, people are called by phone in a 
way that creates the impression that they are coming from a real institution, and the deceived person 
is asked to enter information such as their password by giving various excuses. Phishing can also be 
done through unknown software downloaded from unreliable sites and link services that direct to 
fake sites.    

## WHAT ARE THE PROTECTION METHODS FROM PHISHING ATTACKS 
### 1. Spelling Error Checking 
If there are spelling errors in the incoming e-mail, it may be a sign that we have been exposed to a 
phishing attack. It is not common for there to be spelling errors in e-mails coming from corporate 
companies.    

### 2.Checking Email Attachments 
In some cases, an invoice etc. is attached to the incoming e-mail. It is stated that there is a document 
like this. At this point, we should never open attachments to e-mails we suspect.    

### 3.Personal Information Request Control 
To avoid being exposed to phishing attacks, we should not pay attention to any e-mails requesting our 
personal information. No institution requests information from its customers via e-mail. For this 
reason, if we receive an e-mail requesting our personal information, we must delete the relevant e
mail and inform the system administrator of the system we use, if there is one.    

### 4.License Check in Applications 
Phishing attacks; It can also be done through applications downloaded to computers, tablets and 
smartphones. Therefore, we must download the applications we need directly from the source of the 
developers. Downloading apps from third party apps and untrusted sites is risky. We should never 
install applications that do not have a real and valid license or have been activated with fake licenses 
on computers. To be protected, antivirus software must be active at all times.     

### 5.Certificate Check 
To log in to i.e. Paynet screens, you must follow the steps below and check the certificate. You should 
prefer to access the Paynet website by typing "www.paynet.com.tr" in the address bar of the internet 
browser.    

Fraudsters may ask you for your identity information, password, pin, passphrase, your mother's name 
before marriage, through fake SMS, e-mail and social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), fake 
accounts that appear to belong to Paynet, advertisements or fake websites you access through search 
engines. They may ask for your previous surname and similar confidential information.    

Be sure to check the addresses and certificates of the websites you are directed to via SMS, e-mail 
and social media or accessed through search engines. You should see the phrase “Issued to: 
*.paynet.com.tr” in Paynet's web applications. (Image below.) If you see a problem with the 
certificate, do not take any action and inform your bank.
